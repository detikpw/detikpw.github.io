As someone who is not very familiar with Lua, I find it interesting to learn about how they used this language to develop a complex game like Craftomation 101. It's inspiring to see how they managed to create a successful project with Lua, even without using advanced tools like linters at first. The article shows that sometimes, trusting experienced colleagues and using simple setups can lead to good results. I think this story can motivate other developers to try new languages and approaches, even if they seem unfamiliar at first. It also reminds us that the choice of programming language is often influenced by practical factors like team experience and project requirements, rather than just technical features.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"b5436d54-b3d9-55de-a33f-4e8736e0f656","excerpt":"I think developing good habits is very important for developers to improve their skills and be more productive.

From what I read in some articles I've come across, there are some habits that can help. I'm still learning about these things myself, but I believe they can make a big difference in a developer's work.</p>\n<h2>Maintaining a Developer Journal</h2>\n<p>I think keeping a developer journal is a really good idea for developers like us. It can help us track our daily coding work, problem-solving, and learning. This practice is useful for organizing ideas, reviewing past solutions, and seeing where we can improve. It's great for noticing our growth as developers and can be super helpful during performance reviews. We can write down our achievements in any style, even using the STAR format if we want. These notes are like our own list of good things we've done - kind of like a \"bragging notes\" just for ourselves. It can be really useful for updating our CV later or preparing for interviews. I learned the hard way that it's important to keep these notes organized - once I couldn't find my achievements when I needed them! We can also use the journal to reflect on our feelings about work, which might help us understand ourselves better and even boost our career. I'm still learning about all this, but I think it's worth trying for anyone who wants to improve as a developer.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Effective Time Management</h2>\n<p>I think managing our time well is really important for us developers. It helps us get more work done and have a better life balance. I've been trying the Pomodoro Technique with 50-minute work periods, which helps me focus without getting too tired. Another helpful idea is time blocking, where we plan specific times for different tasks. I use an app called <a href=\"https://structured.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Structured</a> for this, and it's really helpful. Making a list of important and urgent tasks, and doing those first, is also a good practice. Setting clear goals, avoiding distractions, and regularly checking if our time management is working are all important. I'm still learning, but I believe these methods can really help us do better in our work. It's not always easy to stick to a schedule, but it's worth trying different approaches to see what works best for each of us.</p>\n<h2>Learning Through Personal Projects</h2>\n<p>I think working on our own projects is a really good way for us developers to get better and try new things. It lets us work on stuff we're interested in, which makes coding more fun. By doing these projects, we can learn about different parts of making software, like frontend, backend, APIs, and databases. I'm still learning about all these, but I find them very interesting. For example, I tried making a web app using Elm (you can see it at aniapp.detik.moe), and I made some Python scripts for scraping game ratings and managing Twitter follows. These projects helped me learn new skills and try out ideas I was curious about. We can learn at our own speed and maybe even make something useful. Plus, these projects are great to show when looking for jobs. They show what we can do beyond school or work. I think it's a good idea for all of us to try making our own projects when we have time, even if they're small. It's not always easy, but it's a fun way to learn and grow as a developer.</p>\n<h2>Continuous Learning and Growth</h2>\n<p>I think it's really important for us developers to keep learning and getting better at our job. We can do this by practicing a lot, going to conferences if we can, talking with other developers online, and trying to know what's new in our field. I've learned that it's good to plan before we start coding. This helps us know what to do and not waste time on things that don't work well. It's also important to take care of ourselves. We should try to exercise, sit properly when we code, and get enough sleep. These things help us work better and stay healthy.</p>\n<h2>Effective Debugging Strategies</h2>\n<p>I think having good strategies for debugging is really important for us developers. One thing I've learned is that it's helpful to approach debugging step by step. First, I try to reproduce the problem consistently. Then, I use print statements or logging to understand what's happening in the code. Sometimes, I use a debugger to go through the code line by line, which can be really useful for tricky problems. Another thing that helps me is to explain the problem to someone else, even if it's just my rubber duck! This often helps me see things I missed. I also try to check for common errors like typos or off-by-one mistakes. When I'm really stuck, I take a break and come back with fresh eyes. It's also good to keep track of the bugs we fix and how we solved them - this can help us learn and solve similar problems faster in the future. I'm still learning new debugging techniques, but I find that being patient and systematic usually helps me find the issue eventually.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/05/22/you-should-keep-a-developer-s-journal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">You should keep a developer’s journal</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"}},{"node":{"id":"fc8f5e68-93ec-504e-9e32-eae272ccf216","excerpt":"'Bisa karena terbiasa', karena terbiasa ini menjadi sebuah kebiasaan lalu menjadi sebuah rutinitas.

Pada tahapan awal tersulit yaitu ketika menyebrang ke tebing yang lain bergelantungan dengan tali. Setelah sampai di sisi sebarang kita mengaitkan kembali tali, dengan tail yang semakin kuat dan kokoh kita dapat berjalan di atas tali, selanjutnya dibuat simpul-simpul sehingga tali semakin kuat dan kokoh, tahapan terakhir memasang papan sebagai alas jembatan sehingga kita semakin mudah menyeberang antar tebing tersebut <sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Belajar dari ilustrasi tersebut untuk membangun sebuah kebiasaan sangat sulit di awal, namun bila sudah jadi kebiasaan selanjutnya akan lebih mudah.
