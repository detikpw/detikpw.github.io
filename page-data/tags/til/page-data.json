It's like OpenAI's Sora, but maybe even better. Kling can create 2-minute videos in high quality (1080p and 30 fps) and uses cool 3D technology to make realistic faces and movements. It's impressive how it can understand complex scenes and follow physics rules. While OpenAI's Sora is not out yet, Kling is already available for some users in China through an app called Kwaiying. It's exciting to see how AI is changing the way we make videos, and I wonder how this will affect things like advertising in the future.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"0ab324d1-4273-5ac4-8546-f66743027680","excerpt":"After reading the article \"What do I think about Lua after shipping a project with 60,000 lines of code?\", I feel very impressed by the experience shared by Ivan Trusov.

As someone who is not very familiar with Lua, I find it interesting to learn about how they used this language to develop a complex game like Craftomation 101. It's inspiring to see how they managed to create a successful project with Lua, even without using advanced tools like linters at first. The article shows that sometimes, trusting experienced colleagues and using simple setups can lead to good results. I think this story can motivate other developers to try new languages and approaches, even if they seem unfamiliar at first. It also reminds us that the choice of programming language is often influenced by practical factors like team experience and project requirements, rather than just technical features.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"60251757-214b-5300-b8aa-c7eb77af2f1c","excerpt":"Today I learned more about Gleam, a fascinating programming language that caught my eye.

I was actually looking into Elixir, but Gleam popped up on my timeline recently, and I got distracted into revisiting its introduction just for fun. Gleam is a statically-typed functional language running on the Erlang virtual machine, promising to blend reliability with scalability. What really intrigues me is its type system with full type inference and algebraic data types, which could help catch errors early in development. As someone who's spent countless hours debugging, this feature alone has me excited about Gleam's potential.</p>\n<p>While Gleam is still relatively new and its ecosystem is growing, it's showing promise in addressing common development challenges. Its ability to compile to both Erlang and JavaScript opens up possibilities for various applications, from backend services to web development. Here's an example from the Gleam documentation that showcases its pattern matching capabilities:</p>\n<pre><code>pub fn describe(x) {\n  case x {\n    0 -> \"Zero\"\n    n if n &#x3C; 0 -> \"Negative\"\n    n if n > 0 -> \"Positive\"\n  }\n}\n\npub fn main() {\n  io.println(describe(0))    // Prints: Zero\n  io.println(describe(-5))   // Prints: Negative\n  io.println(describe(10))   // Prints: Positive\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I really like Gleam's syntax as it reminds me of when I used Elm, ReasonML, and F#. This example demonstrates Gleam's elegant pattern matching, which is a powerful feature in functional programming. Though it's interesting to explore new technologies like Gleam, I'll probably focus more on Elixir or Haskell for now, given its more active job market. Still, it's exciting to see how languages like Gleam might shape the future of programming.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"e795fa2a-2f25-5a5f-80ac-9e699fd20659","excerpt":"TypeScript 5.5 introduces significant improvements in type inference for array operations, particularly with the filter method.
