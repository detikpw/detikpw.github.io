When I first installed it, I was unsure how useful it would be, given my unfamiliarity with Vim commands. Over time, however, I've grown to appreciate its keyboard-centric approach. The ability to navigate websites without reaching for the mouse has made my browsing more efficient. I particularly like the 'f' and 'F' key for activating links / navigating and the 'j,k,gg,G' for scrolling, 'yy' to copy current active tab url, visual mode to easy and fast copy the text, which I use frequently in my daily tasks as a web developer. While I'm still learning new features, I find that Vimium has modestly improved my productivity. It's not a revolutionary change, but it's a nice enhancement to my workflow. If you're curious about trying a keyboard-focused browsing experience, Vimium might be worth a look, even if you're not familiar with Vim. I'm grateful to my coworker for introducing me to this extension. For those interested in learning more, I found Andrew Courter's YouTube video \"Use Vim in Chrome - Using Vimium\" to be a helpful starting point. Indeed, there are alternatives to Vimium that I occasionally explore, like cVim, especially when encountering bugs or unexpected behavior in Vimium. However, over the past few years, Vimium has shown remarkable stability and performance, which has led me to stick with it consistently. Nevertheless, I’m open to the possibility that there might be newer tools or extensions that could offer an even better experience than Vimium.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jeRSReSbxjw?si=MHRjCW6WM_wqFel_\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"browser"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3227916582","3466794131","996704362"]}
