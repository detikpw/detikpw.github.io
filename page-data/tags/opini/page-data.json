It's like OpenAI's Sora, but maybe even better. Kling can create 2-minute videos in high quality (1080p and 30 fps) and uses cool 3D technology to make realistic faces and movements. It's impressive how it can understand complex scenes and follow physics rules. While OpenAI's Sora is not out yet, Kling is already available for some users in China through an app called Kwaiying. It's exciting to see how AI is changing the way we make videos, and I wonder how this will affect things like advertising in the future.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"0ab324d1-4273-5ac4-8546-f66743027680","excerpt":"After reading the article \"What do I think about Lua after shipping a project with 60,000 lines of code?\", I feel very impressed by the experience shared by Ivan Trusov.

As someone who is not very familiar with Lua, I find it interesting to learn about how they used this language to develop a complex game like Craftomation 101. It's inspiring to see how they managed to create a successful project with Lua, even without using advanced tools like linters at first. The article shows that sometimes, trusting experienced colleagues and using simple setups can lead to good results. I think this story can motivate other developers to try new languages and approaches, even if they seem unfamiliar at first. It also reminds us that the choice of programming language is often influenced by practical factors like team experience and project requirements, rather than just technical features.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"opini"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3227916582","3466794131","996704362"]}
