As someone who is not very familiar with Lua, I find it interesting to learn about how they used this language to develop a complex game like Craftomation 101. It's inspiring to see how they managed to create a successful project with Lua, even without using advanced tools like linters at first.

It also reminds us that the choice of programming language is often influenced by practical factors like team experience and project requirements, rather than just technical features.</p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"After reading the article \"What do I think about Lua after shipping a project with 60,000 lines of code?\", I feel very impressed by the experience shared by Ivan Trusov.
