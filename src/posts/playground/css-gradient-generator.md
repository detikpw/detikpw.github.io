I just found this website called CSS Gradient Generator. It's free and really easy to use! it helps me as playground to make  color gradients. You can make different types of gradients and choose any colors you want. The best part? It gives you the CSS code right away, so you can use it in your projects. I'm not an expert, but this tool makes me feel like I can make my websites look amazing. I can't wait to try it out more!
